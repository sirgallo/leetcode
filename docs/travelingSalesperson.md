# traveling salesperson

runtime complexity (big O) is O(n!)

In this algorithm, a salesperson has to travel between n number of cities while traveling the minimum distance between all of them.

If, let's say, he wants to travel between 5 cities, there are 120 permutations. For 6, there are 720. For 7, there are 5,040 operations.

In the case of the traveling salesperson problem, there are no algorithms that are known that are faster that O(n!).
