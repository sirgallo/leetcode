## approach

I am taking a learn first, implement second approach to leetcode. Some algorithms I have forgotten since school and I want to touch on them again before I begin attempting challenges. Within this repository is [docs](./docs/), which will contain first hand notes for me to relearn. In [practice](./packages/practice/), I will implement the algorithms first. [challenges](./packages/challenges/) will contain all of the leetcode challenges that I complete. All algorithms will be completed in Typescript.

I will attempt at least 2 problems a day, starting with easy and moving up.
